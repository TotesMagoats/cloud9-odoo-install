# Odoo Version 8.0 Installation script for Cloud 9 IDE

Cloud 9 is an exceptional web based development environment. 
This script allows the user to very simply get up and running for Odoo development on the Cloud 9 cloud based IDE.

##Notes
* The Odoo source code is about 1GB in size.  The Cloud9 free tier is only 1GB, so you will have to sign up for a paid plan in order to run this script without it failing.
* I recommend a Medium tier plan and server size for running odoo.  It's increased memory and file size will make development much faster.
